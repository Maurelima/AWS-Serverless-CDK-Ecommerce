## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create and deploy a serverless application utilizing AWS services and the CDK.

This application includes:
- REST APIs with **AWS API Gateway**.
- **AWS Lambda** functions for backend logic.
- **DynamoDB** for a NoSQL database.
- **AWS S3** for static content and file storage.
- **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.
- **AWS Cognito** for authentication and user management.

---

## Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Minimize infrastructure overhead by leveraging managed AWS services.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales to meet demand using Lambda and API Gateway.
- **High Availability**: Ensures reliability with AWS-managed services.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All infrastructure is defined and deployed using AWS CDK.
- **Authentication**: Secures APIs with AWS Cognito for user management.

## AWS Services Used

This project leverages the following AWS services:

1. **AWS Lambda**  
   Executes backend logic in a serverless environment.

2. **AWS API Gateway**  
   Provides RESTful API endpoints to interact with the application.

3. **AWS DynamoDB**  
   A NoSQL database to store data with low latency and high scalability.

4. **AWS S3**  
   - Hosts static files (e.g., frontend assets or uploaded files).
   - Integrates with Lambda for file processing.

5. **AWS CloudFormation**  
   Manages infrastructure as code using CDK.

6. **AWS CloudWatch**  
   Monitors application logs, performance, and metrics.

7. **AWS Cognito**  
   Handles user authentication and authorization with minimal configuration.

8. **AWS IAM**  
   Manages permissions and access controls for resources and services.

9. **AWS CDK**  
   Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to define and deploy AWS resources using TypeScript.

10. **AWS X-Ray**  
    Provides distributed tracing for better debugging and performance monitoring.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for Lambda functions.
- **AWS CDK**: Framework for defining cloud infrastructure as code.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed superset of JavaScript used for CDK definitions.
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for low-latency operations.
- **API Gateway**: Manages RESTful APIs with built-in scalability and security.
- **Cognito**: Simplified user authentication with OAuth and JWT support.
